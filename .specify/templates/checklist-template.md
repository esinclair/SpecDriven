# [CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what this checklist covers]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md or relevant documentation]

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The checklist items below are SAMPLE ITEMS for illustration only.
  
  The /speckit.checklist command MUST replace these with actual items based on:
  - User's specific checklist request
  - Feature requirements from spec.md
  - Technical context from plan.md
  - Implementation details from tasks.md
  
  DO NOT keep these sample items in the generated checklist file.

## Spring-First Development (if applicable)

- [ ] CHK000 Uses Spring annotations for dependency injection (`@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@RestController`)
- [ ] CHK000 Uses Spring MVC annotations for HTTP endpoints (`@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.)
- [ ] CHK000 Uses `@Valid` or `@Validated` with Bean Validation annotations for input validation
- [ ] CHK000 Uses `@ControllerAdvice` + `@ExceptionHandler` for centralized error handling
- [ ] CHK000 Uses Spring Data repositories or `JdbcTemplate` for database operations (not manual JDBC)
- [ ] CHK000 Uses `@Transactional` for transaction management (not manual transaction handling)
- [ ] CHK000 Uses Spring Security annotations for authorization when applicable
- [ ] CHK000 Uses `@ConfigurationProperties` or `@Value` for configuration injection
- [ ] CHK000 No custom solutions where Spring provides equivalent functionality (or deviation documented)

## Public API Compatibility (if applicable)

- [ ] CHK000 No explicit API versioning added (no `/v1` paths; no version headers/query params/media types)
- [ ] CHK000 Existing operations remain backward compatible (no new REQUIRED request inputs)
- [ ] CHK000 Any request additions are OPTIONAL with sensible defaults (no behavior change if omitted)
- [ ] CHK000 Response changes are additive only (only additional fields) and clients can ignore them
- [ ] CHK000 Any endpoint that may return multiple items uses a paged result set (no unbounded list/array responses)

## Feature Flags (if applicable)

- [ ] CHK000 New feature/non-trivial behavior change is gated by `FeatureFlag.<featureName>` (Spring boolean property)
- [ ] CHK000 Flag semantics are correct: `true` enables, `false` disables
- [ ] CHK000 Default value is explicit and documented (spec/plan) and matches implementation
- [ ] CHK000 Tests cover both enabled and disabled modes where feasible

## [Category 1]
